# AnimoReads 404 Page

This is a custom 404 page for AnimoReads, a website dedicated to promoting reading and literacy. The page is designed to be displayed when a user encounters a "404 Not Found" error, indicating that the requested page or resource could not be found.

## Purpose

The purpose of the AnimoReads 404 Page is to provide a user-friendly and informative experience for users who land on a non-existent page. Instead of a generic error message, the custom 404 page aims to guide users back to the main website.
